> The simple, all in one test runner for JavaScript

POW is a simple test runner for JavaScript (works in [the browser and on Node 8+](./guides/compatibility.md)). It can be used to run spec, benchmark and impact tests, while also letting you customize the runner (reporters, ui, etc) via plugins.

## WIP

This project is under construction (no bulldozers involved), so expect constant API changes until _v1_.
