This file is the canonical resource for compatibility goals for POW.

## ES2017

The source is written in [ES2017][ES8] and requires no transpiler or polyfills.

POW uses feature detection to support ES2017+ features, but does not rely on any of the new syntax introduced in these later editions and remains compatible with [ES2017][ES8] runtimes.

## Runtimes

POW aims at supporting the following runtimes:

* Firefox 45+
* Chrome 48+
* Internet Explorer 11+
* Edge 14+
* Safari 9+
* Node 8+ (LTS versions only)
